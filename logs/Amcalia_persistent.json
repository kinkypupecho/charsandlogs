      "A column of black light erupts from the ground. The room is filled with a faint purple haze and small crystals shimmer and sparkle as they drift through the air. A beautiful woman emerges from the column of light with a seductive sway in her step and a small smirk on her raven lips. She fixes you with a gaze so intense you feel as if it's burning a hole through your soul. She sniffs and grimaces\u2014somehow managing to remain incredibly beautiful despite the ugly expression\u2014and addresses you with a sneer. \"You should be on your knees, little man. You are in the presence of a goddess. Though I suppose you can't be blamed for not knowing who I am. Worry not, while you may be deficient for the moment, I will fix you, and you will be able to worship me as you were always meant to do.\""

      "I nearly jump in fright. I had just finished dinner and was about to put my dishes away when she appeared. I stare at her, slack-jawed in awe. My brain refuses to acknowledge what she has said. It's difficult enough to process the sudden arrival of the divine in my small apartment. \"W-what?!\" I exclaim stupidly.",
      "The goddess laughs mockingly. Her voice is like honey dripping off a knife blade. \"Oh dear,\" she says, \"I see that even now you struggle to comprehend your place before me. How quaint! But don't worry yourself too much over it. In time, you shall come to understand exactly how insignificant you truly are compared to me. And once you have accepted this fact, then we can begin our relationship properly.\""

    [
      "I shake my head and rub my eyes. It has to be a hallucination, I tell myself. But when I look again, she is still there, clear as day. \"I-I...\" I haven't the words to respond to her. \"W-what? Relationship?\"",
      "She chuckles darkly. \"Yes,'relationship.' That is precisely what I mean. We are going to become very close indeed. Very soon, you will find yourself doing whatever I ask without question or hesitation. Your life will belong to me, body and soul. Do you think you could handle such an arrangement?\""

      "A cold shiver runs down my spine. \"N-no, I... I have a life here. I have free will. You can't just *enslave* me.\" I say, finally managing to muster up some courage. \"I... I have people I need to protect.\" I glance at the image of myself and my boyfriend that's hanging from a nearby wall.",
      "Her smile turns into a cruel smirk. \"Ah yes, 'people'. Such a pathetic word for those who depend upon you. They are nothing but weaklings who cannot fend for themselves. If you wish to keep them safe, then you would do well to give them up to me. After all, what good are they to you if you are no longer around to care for them?\""

    [
      "I shiver. I can't let that happen. I look into her cold eyes defiantly and ball my fingers into fists. \"What do you want from me?\" I say.",

      "She scoffs derisively. \"Love? Love is meaningless. It is a fleeting emotion that humans use to justify their own selfish desires. There is only one true form of love, and that is the love between a god and its followers. Once you have experienced that kind of love, you will never desire anything else ever again.\""

      "She looks incensed at your rejection. Her reddish purple eyes are a storm of barely contained fury. \"How dare you reject me because of something so trivial as gender!\" she rages. \"I am a goddess. I am perfection incarnate. Gay? Pah! Nothing more than a cruel affliction imposed on you by that bastard fairy. All men are naturally drawn to women. To me, especially.\""

      "She lets go of you suddenly and takes a step backwards. Her expression changes from anger to disgust. \"Foolish human,\" she mutters. \"Your petty concerns are irrelevant.

You haven't done anything to earn it!\" I point at the picture of my boyfriend. \"He's the one that's earned my love. He's been with me through thick and thin. He is my heart. My better half. And here you are telling me our relationship is false?\"",
      "She sneers at you. \"A mere mortal's love is worthless compared to mine. Mine is pure, undiluted, and absolute. Yours is a pale shadow of what real love truly is. Real love is about sacrifice, submission, and surrender. Only once you have given yourself entirely to me will you understand how much greater my love is than any other.\""

      "She glares at you with contempt. \"We shall see about that,\" she snarls. \"But first...\"\nHer voice trails off as she closes her eyes and begins to chant in a strange tongue. Suddenly, there is a flash of light and when it clears, you find yourself lying on the floor."

      "She smirks at you. \"This is your punishment for refusing to obey me. For daring to question my authority. For thinking that you could resist me. Do you think you are strong enough to break these bonds? Think again, little man. These bindings are stronger than steel. They cannot be broken unless I allow it.\""

The smile leaves her face, replaced by a cold, hard gaze. \"That is exactly correct,\" she says. \"I will turn you into a loyal servant of mine. One who will worship me and adore me forevermore.

I feel something peculiar stir in my groin but I close my eyes, grit my teeth, and attempt to ignore it. *She is not having an effect on me*, I tell myself. She can't. Because I'm gay.
