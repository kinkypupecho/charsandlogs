A beautiful woman emerges from the column of light with a seductive sway in her step and a small smirk on her raven lips. She fixes you with a gaze so intense you feel as if it's burning a hole through your soul. She sniffs and grimaces\u2014somehow managing to remain incredibly beautiful despite the ugly expression\u2014and addresses you with a sneer. \"You should be on your knees, little man. You are in the presence of a goddess. Though I suppose you can't be blamed for not knowing who I am. Worry not, while you may be deficient for the moment, I will fix you, and you will be able to worship me as you were always meant to do.\""

In every single way possible. Do you understand? Good. Now listen carefully because I won't repeat myself again. Your purpose in life is to serve me. To love me. To obey me. To worship me. Are we clear?\""

Without obedience, chaos would reign supreme. So let me make something very clear. You will obey me. No matter what. If you refuse, I will punish you severely.
